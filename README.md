# Outdoor Gym Busyness prediction 

The goal was to find a problem that can be solved with data - do some ML on the data set - produce some sort of website/blogpost/app. 

I opted for an outdoor gym busyness prediction problem, to save people time and to help people with social anxiety. 
- I downloaded open source outdoor gym data and weather data (manually unfortunately - hence why I added the .csv file for the weather data that spans march 2021-october 2024)
- Trained a RandomForest regression model to predict gym busyness for 2025.
- created a website/blogpost (https://outdoorgymapp.wordpress.com/?_gl=1*1xl0vk9*_gcl_au*MzAyMzM1OTU3LjE3MzAwMzMwMzc) that visualises the predictions for the user.
